A comprehensive system designed to manage educational activities, facilitating interaction between Doctors (Instructors) and Students within courses.

## 🔗 Quick Links
*   [Main Entry Point](src/main.cpp)
*   [System Controller](src/EducationalManagementSystem.hpp)
*   [Doctor Logic](src/Doctor.hpp)
*   [Student Logic](src/Student.hpp)

## ✨ Features
*   **Role-Based Access Control**: Doctors and Students have unique permissions and workflows.
*   **Course Management**: Create, list, and register for courses.
*   **Assignment System**: Issue assignments and submit solutions with grading support.

    *   Show Grades Report
    *   List/View Student Solutions
*   **Solution Actions**: Print Content | **Set Grade** | **Set Comment**

### 👨‍🎓 User: Student
*   **Data Profile**: Managed by ID, Name, and Email.
*   **Main Menu**: Register in Course | List My Courses | View Course | Grades Report
*   **Register in Course**: Displays a list of all available courses (excluding already registered ones).
