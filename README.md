# C++ OOP Projects

This repository showcases a collection of projects built using C++ with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Each project demonstrates different aspects of C++ and OOP, from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

## Projects

Here's a list of the projects included in this repository:

1.  **Employee Program**: A simple console-based application for managing employee data.
2.  **Tic Tac Toe Game**: A classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++.
3.  **Hospital System**: A basic system for managing patients in a hospital.
4.  **Library System V1**: A console-based library management system for managing books and users.
5.  **Library System V2**: An improved version of the library system with additional features.
6.  **Ask Me System**: A question and answer platform, similar to a simplified version of Stack Overflow.
7.  **Educational Management System**: A comprehensive system for managing courses, students, and assignments in an educational institution.

## Building and Running the Projects

Each project is self-contained in its own directory. To build and run a specific project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in the corresponding `.vscode/tasks.json` file or use the provided executable.

For example, to run the "Employee Program", you would navigate to the `01 employee program` directory and execute the `system` file.

```bash
cd "01 employee program"
./system
```
